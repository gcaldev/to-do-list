# To do List

## Intro
This is my first django project. I decided to develop a to do list in order to get familiar with Django framework, learn how to do a asynchronous request with Ajax and Jquery, and to learn how to do a basic CRUD app.
## Features
### Search Bar
- Lets you find the desired task by it's title. In case the task is in the list, the website will show you a modal window with all the task information (Without refreshing). If the task has not been found, the site will show an error label.
- Adds a new task, validating all the field with javascript.
### Configuration Button
- Edits the selected task fields.
- Removes the selected task.
### Remove Button
- Removes the selected task without refreshing the page.
